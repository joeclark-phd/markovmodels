## markovmodels

I found myself writing code for multi-order Markov chains in [joeclark-phd/random-text-generators](https://github.com/joeclark-phd/random-text-generators) and realized that I might need them in a few different kinds of procedural generation tasks.  So this will be a generalized and reusable version of Markov chain random generation with multiple orders and optional priors.

Lots of remaining TODOs before it's ready...
